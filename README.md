The user can input here, the name of the country that they want to discover. More countries will be added as we develop the project further. 

Then, the website will redirect the user to a page where there are tables of information regarding the top 8 tourist attractions in each country.

For developer:
  - if the developer would like to add more countries, they can run spider.py file and input the name of the country they want to generate the data. All the data will automatically be added to the table named 'travel'. The website's data is connected to the table 'travel', it will update automatically.
